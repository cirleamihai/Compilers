### Syntax Rules:

1. Program structure:
   program ::= statement_list

2. Statements:
   statement_list ::= statement {";"} | statement {";"} statement_list
   statement ::= assign_statement | io_statement | control_statement | loop_statement | function_statement

3. Assignment:
   assign_statement ::= identifier ":=" expression

4. Expressions:
   expression ::= term | expression "+" term | expression "-" term
   term ::= factor | term "*" factor | term "/" factor
   factor ::= identifier | constant | "(" expression ")"

5. Input/Output:
   io_statement ::= "print" "(" argument_list ")"
   argument_list ::= identifier | string | identifier "," argument_list

6. Control Statements:
   control_statement ::= "if" "(" condition ")" "{" statement_list "}" [ "else" "{" statement_list "}" ]

7. Loop Statements:
   loop_statement ::= "for" "(" identifier "in" list ")" "{" statement_list "}"
   list ::= "[" element_list "]"
   element_list ::= constant | constant "," element_list

8. Conditions:
   condition ::= expression relational_operator expression
   relational_operator ::= "<" | "<=" | "=" | ">" | ">=" | "!="

9. Function Statements:
    function_statement ::= type identifier "(" parameter_list ")" "{" statement_list "}"
    type ::= "int" | "float" | "bool" | "void" | "list"
    parameter_list ::= identifier | identifier "," parameter_list
